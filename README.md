# EDA-PowerBi-Project

📌 Project Overview
This project involves a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Supermarket sales dataset followed by the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize and interpret key business insights. The objective is to understand customer behavior, sales patterns, product performance, and operational efficiency to support data-driven decision-making.

🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), the EDA uncovered patterns and trends in sales, customer segments, shipping modes, product categories, and regional performance.

🔍 Key EDA Insights:
Top-selling products by volume and revenue
Sales trends over months and years
Customer segmentation by region
Shipping time analysis and delay trends
Product category performance and average sales
Identification of repeat customers
State-wise and city-wise revenue contribution
Each of these analyses helped lay the foundation for meaningful, real-time visualizations in Power BI.

📊 Power BI Dashboard
The final dashboard provides:
Interactive filtering by segment, region, and product
Drill-down views into sales by time, location, and category
KPIs like total sales, average shipping time, top states/products
Visual storytelling through heatmaps, bar charts, line trends, and donut charts
This allows stakeholders to explore the data intuitively and make strategic business decisions.
